   - Use **`<p>`** for paragraphs of text.
   - Use **`<ul>`** and **`<li>`** for bullet points or lists.
   - Use **`<img>`** for image placeholders where relevant (include a descriptive `alt` attribute).
   - Add links using **`<a href>`** when necessary.

3. **Formatting Guidelines**:
   - Ensure the HTML structure is clean, logical, and properly nested.
   - Do **not alter** the content of the text. Only apply tags to format it.
   - Ensure compatibility with WordPress standards.

4. **Output the Formatted HTML**:
   - Present the final output as properly indented HTML code.

- The output should be a **pure HTML string**, free of unnecessary comments, markers, or formatting outside of valid HTML.
