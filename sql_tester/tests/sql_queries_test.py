"""
This module contains integration tests for SQL queries used in the pharmaceutical data pipeline.

The tests are designed to verify the correctness of SQL queries by comparing
their results against pre-computed expected results stored in CSV files.

Classes:
    TestSQLQueries: A unittest.TestCase subclass that tests the execution
    and validation of SQL queries against expected results.

Usage:
    Run this module with unittest to execute the SQL integration tests.
    Example:
        python -m unittest tests/test_sql.py
